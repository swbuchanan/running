# running

This project is inspired by http://pac.tom7.org/index.shtml, but significantly less well-defined and less likely to be completed.
It's also based in Canberra.

Currently all I have is some boilerplate code that will let me plot gpx files on a map.

# Setup

Create a file called something or other with your strava info etc TODO: finish this

## to-do:
- a lot of running
- some way of auto-downloading my strava activities
- set up some rules for the project
- mobile-compatible webapp with a map that shows my current progress and my location so I can easily find new places to run
- more stuff??
